# Create-one-s-own-shell-program-on-Linux

This is a program written by the C programming language which contains a source file and a header file with a self-defined PATH variable in it.

You can edit and update the code on your demand. Then compile and run the program on Linux. Type some command while running the program such as "cd", "ls", "man" and so on like you are type something in a real shell without a stand-alone interface. For the most satisfaction, you may go back update and compile the code and do this again and again.

Just feel easy and have fun.
